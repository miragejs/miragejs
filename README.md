# Ember CLI Mirage


A client-side server to develop, test and prototype your Ember CLI app.

<http://www.ember-cli-mirage.com/>

----

Are you tired of

- Writing one set of fixtures for your tests, and another for development?
- Wiring up tests for each of your apps manually, from scratch?
- Changing lots of files/tests when your API changes?

Ember CLI Mirage may be for you! It lets you create a client-side server using [Pretender](https://github.com/trek/pretender) to help you develop and test your app. By default, it only runs if you're not in production and if you're not proxying to an explicit API server via `ember serve --proxy`.

## Installation

```sh
ember install ember-cli-mirage  # install:addon for Ember CLI < 0.2.3
```

## Updating

This project is new and the API is subject to change. When updating your project to a newer version of Ember CLI Mirage, please consult [the changelog](/CHANGELOG.md) for any update notes.

## Getting started
