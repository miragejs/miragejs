## 1.0 Upgrade guide

There were a few breaking changes made in the 1.0 release.

### 1. Remove Faker.js

When Mirage was first released, including npm libraries into Ember CLI apps was difficult. You needed to generate a vendor shim and call `app.import` in order to use the library in your application code.

Because of all this ceremony, it was common for addons to do that work for you, and bundle related packages. This is exactly what Mirage did for [Faker.js](https://github.com/Marak/faker.js), a useful library to have alongside your Mirage factory definitions.

There's a few problems with this, most notably that users _had_ to use the version of Faker that was bundled with Mirage. It was frustrating not being able to take advantage of new Faker features until Mirage upgraded its bundled version.

Now, thanks to [Ember Auto Import](https://github.com/ef4/ember-auto-import), this is no longer the case. Using dependencies directly from npm is painless â€“Â just `yarn/npm install` them and `import` them directly from your ES6 classes. Thanks to Auto Import, all that ceremony is taken care of for you.

This also means that users can easily manage their project's version of Faker (and other similar dependencies) independently of the version of Mirage they're using.

For this reason, in 1.0 we are no longer bundling Faker.js with Mirage. This is a breaking change.

Here are the steps you'll need to take to fix this:

1. Install Ember Auto Import (if it's not already installed)

  ```sh
  ember install ember-auto-import
  ```

2. Install Faker.js directly from npm:

  ```sh
  yarn add -D faker

  # or npm install --save-dev faker
  ```

3. Change all imports of `faker` from the `ember-cli-packge` to import directly from `faker`:

  ```diff
  - import { Factory, faker } from 'ember-cli-mirage';
  + import { Factory } from 'ember-cli-mirage';
  + import faker from 'faker';
  ```

[There is a codemod](https://github.com/samselikoff/ember-cli-mirage-faker-codemod/tree/update-transform) that will do this for you, thanks to the gracious work of [Casey Watts](https://github.com/caseywatts).

Additionally, when I originally bundled Faker, I monkey-patched it with some methods that I thought would be "useful" additions. I thought this was a good idea at the time... it wasn't. ðŸ™ˆ

You can look at [the module from v0.4.15](https://github.com/samselikoff/ember-cli-mirage/blob/v0.4.15/addon/faker.js) to see that we added the `faker.list.random`, `faker.list.cycle` and `faker.random.number.range` methods, so if you use these methods too, you'll need to refactor them.

Fortunately, two of them have been added to recent versions of Faker, and one can be replaced with some simple JS:

For `faker.list.random`, use `faker.random.arrayElement`:

```diff
  countries() {
-   return faker.list.random([ 'United States of America', 'Canada', 'Mexico' ]);
+   return faker.random.arrayElement([ 'United States of America', 'Canada', 'Mexico' ]);
  }
```

For `faker.list.cycle`, use the remainder (modulo) operator:

```diff
  countries(i) {
-   return faker.list.cycle([ 'United States of America', 'Canada', 'Mexico' ]);

+   let countries = [ 'United States of America', 'Canada', 'Mexico' ];
+   
+   return countries[i % countries.length];
  }
```

For `faker.random.number.range`, use `faker.random.number` with min and max options:

```diff
  age() {
-   return faker.random.number.range(18, 65);
+   return faker.random.number({ min: 18, max: 65 });
  }
```

After that, you should be on your own with respect to Faker! Thanks to Auto Import, you can change versions, or even try out other libraries like [Chance.js](https://chancejs.com/), and rest easy knowing Mirage is a bit slimmer and one less thing is beyond your control.

### 2. New import for setupMirage

Please use the new named import for the setupMirage test helper. The old one still works for now but is not robust to us refactoring the internal file location. The named export is also more aligned with the rest of the ecosystem.

```js
// Before
import setupMirage from 'ember-cli-mirage/test-support/setup-mirage';

// After
import { setupMirage } from 'ember-cli-mirage/test-support';
```

### 3. Remove deprecated forms of `create`, `createList` and `normalizedRequestAttrs`

There are several places in Mirage's APIs that were intended to be used with singularized versions of model names, but just so happened to work if a non-singularized version was passed in.

This behavior was discovered during a refactor, and the non-singularized versions were maintained to avoid breaking apps. Now that we're moving to 1.0, we're removing this deprecated/unintentional behavior.

- `server.create` and `server.createList` were coded to take a singularized model name, e.g. `server.create('user')`. It just so happens that `server.create('users')` also works. That pluralized version is now removed from Mirage.

    If you're running the latest 0.x version you should see a deprecation message letting you know where to change it. Otherwise, it should be a pretty mechanic change from things like `server.create('users')` to `server.create('user')`.

    Note this also applies to `server.createList` â€“Â the correct form is `server.createList('user', 3)`, and the pluralized form `server.createList('users', 3)` is now unsupported.

- `this.normalizedRequestAttrs` in a route handler optionally takes a modelName as an argument. This is if your URLs are non-standard and Mirage cannot guess the modelName from the URL path.

    In this case, you can call `this.normalizedRequestAttrs('blog-post')` to tell Mirage to expect the payload to be for a `blog-post` model.

    This API was intended to be used with dasherized names, because that's how compound model names are specified throughout Mirage when they are represented as strings.

    It just so happened that `this.normalizedRequestAttrs('blogPost')` also worked, by chance, until a refactor. So, that behavior was kept but now is being removed.

    The correct usage is `this.normalizedRequestAttrs('blog-post')`. Using the camelized version of the model name is no longer supported.

If either of these changes cause a ton of refactoring pain, we can try to marshal some resources to help write a codemod. Please open an issue if that's the case!

### 4. The `normalizeIds` serializer property now defaults to true

This applies to the ActiveModelSerializer and RestSerializer.

The `normalize` property on serializers helps Mirage's shorthands work by transforming differently formatted payloads into JSON:API documents. These documents are then used by Mirage to update the database accordingly.

There was a gap in the default `normalize` method for a long time, in that it didn't take REST payloads that included foreign keys and looked like

```js
let payload = {
  contact: {
    id: 1,
    name: 'Link',
    address: 1
  }
};
```

and turn that `address` key into a proper JSON:API relationship:

```js
data: {
  type: 'contacts',
  id: 1,
  attributes: {
    name: 'Link'
  },
  relationships: {
    address: {
      data: {
        type: 'address',
        id: 1
      }
    }
  }
}
```

We added this feature a while ago, and it's controlled with the `normalizeIds` property on the ActiveModelSerializer and RESTSerializer. (We did this so the feature wouldn't be a breaking change.)

We're now making `true` the default, which should be the behavior everyone desires (assuming they're using shorthands). This is technically a breaking change, though it's unlikely to affect most people.


## 0.3.x â†’ 0.4 Upgrade guide

There is one primary change in 0.4 that could break your 0.3 app.

In 0.3.x, Mirage's JSONAPISerializer included all related foreign keys whenever serializing a model or collection, even if those relationships were not being `included` in the payload.

This actually goes against JSON:API's design. Foreign keys in the payload are known as [Resource Linkage](http://jsonapi.org/format/#document-resource-object-linkage) and are intended to be used by API clients to link together all resources in a JSON:API compound document. In fact, most server-side JSON:API libraries do not automatically serialize all related foreign keys, and only return linkage data for related resources when they are being included in the current document.

By including linkage data for every relationship in 0.3, it was easy to develop Ember apps that would work with Mirage but would behave differently when hooked up to a standard JSON:API server. Since Mirage always included linkage data, an Ember app might automatically be able to fetch related resources using the ids from that linkage data plus its knowledge about the API. For example, if a `post` came back like this:

```js
// GET /posts/1
{
  data: {
    type: 'posts',
    id: '1',
    attributes: { ... },
    relationships: {
      author: {
        data: {
          type: 'users',
          id: '1'
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

and you forgot to `?include=author` in your GET request, Ember Data would potentially use the `user:1` foreign key and lazily fetch the `author` by making a request to `GET /authors/1`. This is problematic because

1. This is not how foreign keys are intended to be used
2. It'd be better to see no data and fix the problem by going back up to your data-loading code and add `?include=author` to your GET request, or
3. If you do want your interface to lazily load the author, use resource `links` instead of the resource linkage `data`:

```js
// GET /posts/1
{
  data: {
    type: 'posts',
    id: '1',
    attributes: { ... },
    relationships: {
      author: {
        links: {
          related: '/api/users/1'
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Resource links can be defined on Mirage serializers using the [links](http://www.ember-cli-mirage.com/docs/v0.3.x/serializers/#linksmodel) method (though `including` is likely the far more simpler and common approach to fetching related data).

So, Mirage 0.4 changed this behavior and by default, the JSONAPISerializer only includes linkage data for relationships that are being included in the current payload (i.e. within the same compound document).

This behavior is configurable via the `alwaysIncludeLinkageData` key on your JSONAPISerializers. It is set to `false` by default, but if you want to opt-in to 0.3 behavior and always include linkage data, set it to `true`:

```js
// mirage/serializers/application.js
import { JSONAPISerializer } from 'ember-cli-mirage';

export default JSONAPISerializer.extend({
  alwaysIncludeLinkageData: true
});
```

If you do this, I would recommend looking closely at how your real server behaves when serializing resources' relationships and whether it uses resource `links` or resource linkage `data`, and to update your Mirage code accordingly to give you the most faithful representation of your server.


## 0.2.x â†’ 0.3 Upgrade guide

The main change from 0.2.x to 0.3.x is that relationships are now one-way. This better matches the semantics of both Ember Data and common HTTP transfer protocols like JSON:API.

In 0.2, the following model definitions

```js
// mirage/models/author.js
import { Model } from 'ember-cli-mirage';

export default Model.extend({

});

// mirage/models/post.js
import { Model, belongsTo } from 'ember-cli-mirage';

export default Model.extend({

  author: belongsTo()

});
```

would have generated a "schema" with a one-to-many relationship between authors and posts: an author has many posts, and a post belongs to an author. Now, this just generates a one-way relationship from `post` to `author`. To have a two-way sync'd relationship, known as an inverse, you'd need to define both sides of the relationship:

```js
// mirage/models/author.js
import { Model, hasMany } from 'ember-cli-mirage';

export default Model.extend({

  posts: hasMany()

});

// mirage/models/post.js
import { Model, belongsTo } from 'ember-cli-mirage';

export default Model.extend({

  author: belongsTo()

});
```

Practically speaking, to upgrade you'll need to go through your code and update relationships that implicitly had inverses (from 0.2.x's hasMany and belongsTo behavior) and update them to define both sides.

This could also affect your fixture files, if you are using those to seed your database. Instead of just having an authorId on the post above, for example, you'd also need the author to have a `postIds: []` array. (In general Factories are better for seeding your database, as they save you from having to manage ids at all.)

Conceptually this change should be straightforward, as its making existing implicit relationships explicit, but if you find yourself having trouble with the upgrade it's probably because of something I haven't thought of. Please reach out to the community on the #ec-mirage channel on Slack and ask for help!

For more information on the motivation behind change, please read the [0-3 beta series release blog post](http://www.ember-cli-mirage.com/blog/2017/01/09/0-3-0-beta-series/).

## 0.1.x â†’ 0.2 Upgrade guide

If you're upgrading your Mirage server from v0.1.x to v0.2.x, here's what you need to know:

  - **The default Mirage directory has changed.** The default Mirage directory has moved from `/app/mirage` to `/mirage`. When you install 0.2.0, the default blueprint will add the `/mirage` directory to your project. You can delete it and move your current Mirage files to the new location with something like

    ```sh
    rm -rf mirage
    mv app/mirage mirage
    ```

    from the root of your project. Mirage's directory is also [customizable](../configuration/#directory) (Although you should move it from the `/app` directory or else it will not be removed from the build in production mode).

  - **All multiword filenames are dasherized.** In Mirage 0.1.x, database collection names were taken from filenames. The idea was, if your API returned snake_case collection keys (e.g. `blog_posts: []`), just name your file `fixtures/blog_posts.js`. This approach turned out to be insufficiently flexib-- what am I saying, it was just a bad idea :P.

    In Mirage 0.2.x, we follow Ember CLI's conventions of dasherized filenames. So, you'll just need to go through and change

    ```sh
    /mirage/factories/blog_post.js
    /mirage/fixtures/blog_post.js
    # etc.
    ```

    to

    ```sh
    /mirage/factories/blog-post.js
    /mirage/fixtures/blog-post.js
    ```

    You will then use the [new Serializer layer](../serializers) to do things like format keys in your json payloads.

  - **All JavaScript properties are camelCased.** Similar to the previous change, factory properties and database collection names followed the format of your API in Mirage 0.1.x. If you were faking an ActiveModelSerializer backend, multiword keys used snake_case throughout your Mirage code. So, your database table might be `db.blog_posts`, and your factory keys might be `first_name() {..}`. Looks pretty cool right?

    Wrong. We're JavaScript developers here, people. It's time to start using camelCase. (Also, the idea of tying these keys to your serialization format was bad, as it left us without any conventions. We need to stick to a single format, so the ORM knows how to find foreign keys.)

    You'll need to update your route handlers, which may look like this:

    ```js
    let posts = db.blog_posts.filter(p => p.author_id === 1);
    ```

    to

    ```js
    let posts = db.blogPosts.filter(p => p.authorId === 1);
    ```

    Note that everything is camelCased, including foreign keys.

    Similarly, factories that look like

    ```js
    export default Factory.extend({
      first_name() {
        return faker.name.firstName();
      },

      last_name() {
        return faker.name.firstName();
      },
    });
    ```

    should be changed to

    ```js
    export default Factory.extend({
      firstName() {
        return faker.name.firstName();
      },

      lastName() {
        return faker.name.firstName();
      },
    });
    ```

    This goes for all attrs that `server.create` takes (and returns), etc. For many this will be the most painful part of the upgrade. Please find it in your heart to forgive me.

  - **Mirage now has its own Model layer (an ORM).** In Mirage 0.1.x, you had to define either a factory or a fixture file (or both) in order for a database collection to be created, which let you take advantage of the db in your route handlers. In 0.2, we've introduced Mirage Models, which serve as the new canonical source of truth about your database.

    To create a model, use

    ```
    ember g mirage-model blog-post
    ```

    This will create a file like

    ```js
    import { Model } from 'ember-cli-mirage';

    export default Model.extend({

    });
    ```

    Having that file sets up the `db.blogPosts` collection, allows you to use the JSON:API serializer, and more. You can still define factories and fixtures - but only if you need them. <!-- not yet! in 0.6.0 For instance, given the model above, `server.create('blog-post')` would create a blank `blog-post` model. You could then make a factory for models that need more customization. --> Models, factories and fixtures all work together, but now you won't be making blank factory or fixture files just to set up your database. The models themselves serve as the source of truth.

    We needed to add models for [association support](../models/#associations) (which currently exists) and factory relationships (the first feature to come after the 0.2 release). Read through the [models guide](../models) and [serializers guide](../serializers) to see how having models can simplify your Mirage server.

    We also have a plan to make a separate addon that could ascertain your model definitions and their relationships from your Ember Data models. Adding the ORM paves the way for this important future addition.

    Currently, Mirage will still work if a factory/fixture file is defined for a particular db collection without a corresponding model. Eventually, we may require all setups to have model definitions for each collection. But for now, to make for an easier upgrade path, you can start generating models and opt-in to the ORM layer in piecemeal.

- **The ORM object `schema` is now injected into route handlers.** In Mirage 0.1.x, the `db` was the first parameter injected into route handlers:

  ```js
  this.get('/posts', function(db, request) {
    // work with db
  });
  ```

  Now, the `schema` object is, so you can take advantage of the Model layer. Fortunately, the `db` hangs directly off of the `schema`, so you can leave all your old route handler code intact (with the exception of making the change to camelCase), and just use destructuring to change the function signature to

  ```js
  this.get('/posts', function({ db }, request) {
    // work with db
  });
  ```

  and then start opting-in to the ORM (and using `schema`) one route handler at a time.

- **Specify a Serializer.** If you're using shorthands, you'll need to pick a serializer in `/mirage/serializers/application.js`. See the [serializers guide](../serializers) for details.
